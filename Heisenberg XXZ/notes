Have a few questions. 
so the code finds representativein O(L^2), i don't now how lintables work but my guess is there is not an improvement better than L^2. 

Somewhat sure we can get faster than that by just rewriting this in lower level language.

Also, is this the longest step, wouldn't the diagonalization itself for each block be slower?

Also, doesn't XXZ has inversion symmetry?

also, though slower, working directly with roots of unity looks more "correct" than casting to floats) (i wont be doing that)


We are not using any cores!!!!
